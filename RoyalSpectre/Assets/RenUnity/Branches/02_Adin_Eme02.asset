    - /start_talk Emeline
    - Oh, well it could have gone better, deary. After seeing to the tables with Millie
      I sat down myself, only to have the merchant sit down across form me.
    - /wait
    - /start_talk Adin
    - Is there something wrong with him?
    - /wait
    - /start_talk Emeline
    - No, no. He's just a strange fellow, foreign. He does things differently. It
      makes me uneasy.
    - /wait
    - Truth be told, I wouldn't be surprised to learn he had something to do with
      the King.
    - /wait
    - /set_flag Merchant
    - /stop_talk
